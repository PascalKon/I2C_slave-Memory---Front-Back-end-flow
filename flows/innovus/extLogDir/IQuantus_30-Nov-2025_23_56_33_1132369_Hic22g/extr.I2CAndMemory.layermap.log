#                          Technology and LEF layer map
# Design "I2CAndMemory"
#
# Technology and LEF layers are mapped automatically by innovus.
# If a user needs customised mapping, specify a layermap file. Layermap file
# is specified using command "setExtractRCMode -lefTechFileMap <layermapFile>".
#

# Mapping of layers are from <lefLayer> to <techLayer>

# Lef file might contain multiple masterslice layers. Only one is printed in log file.
# Innovus does not distinguish between masterslice layers in IQuantus extraction.

# Either no contact layer to Poly in LEF file or it was ignored by Innovus.
# Therefore no mapping created to Poly to metal contact layer 'cont' in technology file.
