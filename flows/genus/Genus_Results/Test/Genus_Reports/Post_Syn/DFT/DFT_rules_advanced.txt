Advanced DFT Rule Violations:
----------------------------------
	 Tristate net contention violation: 1
	Potential race condition violation: 0
	                X-source violation: 0

Warning: There are a total of 1 undriven pins which may act as x-source generators. For the list of pins, use the command 'check_design -undriven -report_scan_pins'.

Warning: There are a total of 1 multiple driver pins or nets which may be considered as being tristated. For the list of multidriven nets or pins, use the command 'check_design -multiple_driver'.
