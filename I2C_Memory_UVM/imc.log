imc: *I,RUNLD: Successfully loaded run cov_work/scope/final.
imc: *W,vrefine.vrefine_bad_rules_checksum_for_cmd: Some rules of refinement file '/home/p/paschalk/Desktop/I2C_Memory/I2C_Memory_UVM/refine.vRefine' might be invalid. This could be because of the changes in source code of some of the instances or types, or due to changes in CCF commands across models.
List of instances/types whose rules seem to be invalid:
I2C_Slave( block )
top.dut.i2c_inst( block )
 

See the log file for a list of entities on which the rules could not be applied.
Note: All valid refinement rules were applied automatically. You can apply all the rules from this refinement file using -apply_all flag, however, it might cause incorrect markings.
imc: *W,vrefine.vrefine_bad_rules_checksum_detail: 
Instances/Types on which rules that are suspected as invalid due to changes in source code or due to changes in CCF commands across models were detected :
